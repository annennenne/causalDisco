# Caugi plot

- Square nodes

# TODO

- Check if skipped tests can be removed (could just add a version check on tetrad in tests?)

- If no tier knowledge drop tier columns in output from knowledge (currently just says NA)?

- Register a custom edge type for caugi to represent forbidden edges differently than normal directed edges.
Would simplify plotting logic and easier to extend later.

```{r register edge, eval = FALSE}
# Doesn't work atm because CRAN version requires length 3 (will work in next release)
caugi::register_caugi_edge(
  glyph = "!-->",
  tail_mark = "arrow",
  head_mark = "tail",
  class = "directed",
  symmetric = FALSE
)
```

# LONGTERM

- Allow star - star (adjaceny) knowledge

- User should only be allowed to give knowledge that matches the knowledge class (e.g. DAG)
