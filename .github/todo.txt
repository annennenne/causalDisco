Make edges, nodes dispatch to avoid nameclash


# Functions to not export

- set_knowledge

- ...

# Remove files not used

- n-dags.R

- plot-tempo-mech.R

- ...

# Caugi plot

- Square nodes

- Label to edges (you already can in `grid.text()`, so maybe not needed?).

# TODO

- Check if skipped tests can be removed (could just add a version check on tetrad in tests?)

- If no tier knowledge drop tier columns in output from knowledge (currently just says NA)?

# LONGTERM

- Allow star - star (adjaceny) knowledge

- User should only be allowed to give knowledge that matches the knowledge class (e.g. DAG)
