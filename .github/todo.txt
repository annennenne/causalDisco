## Changes needed to finish knowledge vignette

Allow tiered knowledge to be plotted as forbidden knowledge instead, see function `forbid_tier_violations()`

Allow time axis on plots (is this needed to be implemented in caugi?)

Plot function to knowledgeable_caugi shouldn't plot knowledge (maybe make a show_knowledge = FALSE) argument as default?

# Caugi plot

- Square nodes

- Label to edges (you already can in `grid.text()`, so maybe not needed?).

# TODO

Check if skipped tests can be removed (could just add a version check on tetrad in tests?)

# LONGTERM

Allow star - star (adjaceny) knowledge

User should only be allowed to give knowledge that matches the knowledge class (e.g. DAG)
