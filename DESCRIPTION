Description: Various tools for inferring causal models from observational data. The package 
    includes an implementation of the temporal Peter-Clark (TPC) algorithm. Petersen, Osler 
    and Ekstr√∏m (2021) <doi:10.1093/aje/kwab087>. It also includes general tools
    for evaluating differences in adjacency matrices, which can be used for evaluating
    performance of causal discovery procedures.
