# causalDisco (development version)

# causalDisco 1.1.0

## New Features

- Exports `list_registered_tetrad_algorithms()` to view the custom registered
  Tetrad algorithms.

- Allows the user to specify custom conditional independence tests for use with
  for the engines bnlearn, causalDisco, and pcalg. The custom test should have
  the signature `function(x, y, conditioning_set, suff_stat)` (optionally with
  an additional `args` argument for additional parameters), and return a
  p-value. See the documentation and the associated vignette for details.

- Added support for micd tests such as `micd::gaussCItestMI()` for pcalg and
  causalDisco engine. See all the new available tests in `?PcalgSearch` and
  `?CausalDiscoSearch` under the test field.

- Simplified the interface for extending causalDisco with new algorithms.
  Exports `make_method()` and `make_runner()` to do this. Please see the
  documentation and the associated vignette for details.

## Improvements

- Improved speed of `tfci()`, `tges()`, and `tpc()` algorithms by at least 3x,
  and often much more.

- Updated `knowledge_to_caugi()` to include information about required and
  forbidden edges in the output.

- Improve documentation for many functions. # causalDisco 1.0.1

- This release should be considered essentially a **new package** with many new
  features, and some breaking changes (mainly renaming functions, arguments, and
  object classes) to be consistent.

- Please see the vignettes and documentation for details on using the new
  features.

# causalDisco 0.9.5

- Fixed warnings and notes from R CMD check regarding documentation.

# causalDisco 0.9.3

- Changed structure of tpdag and tskeleton objects so they include tamat objects
  rather than amat and order slots. This is a major change, not backwards
  compatible!
- tpc now passes ... argument to skeleton() function call
- Added functionality in tpc to handle missing information when using built-in
  tests. Three options are now available: complete case analysis, test wise
  deletion, or no handling (i.e., and error is thrown if there are NAs, this is
  the default and it is backwards compatible).

# causalDisco 0.9.2

- Fixed bug in maketikz() function so it now works with tpdag and tamat objects,
  and added examples to the documentation.

# causalDisco 0.9.1

- Added three new functions: simDAG, simGausFromDAG, nDAGs.
- Changed structure of tamat objects so they inherit directly from matrix.

# causalDisco 0.9.0

- Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.
- First CRAN submission.
