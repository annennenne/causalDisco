`causalDisco` provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax. 

## Motivation
Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in `bnlearn`, `pcalg`, or `Tetrad`, but their APIs vary widely.

`causalDisco` unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on scientific questions rather than package quirks.

## Installation 

### Install `causalDisco`

Install the package from GitHub using `pak`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco")
```

### Installing Rust

`causalDisco` depends on the package [`caugi`](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See [this guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for instructions on how to
install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

`causalDisco` provides an interface to the Java library [`Tetrad`](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from `Tetrad` you need to install JDK 21 (or newer)
[here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (or look at `Tetrad`'s
[Java setup guide](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Java-for-Tetrad)).

The current supported version of `Tetrad` can then be installed by calling

```{r, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

## Example

With `causalDisco` you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the packages `causalDisco` itself,
the Java library `Tetrad`, `bnlearn`, and `pcalg`. 

```{r example}
library(causalDisco)

# load data
data("tpcExample")

# define background knowledge object
kn <- knowledge(
  tpcExample,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

# use Tetrad PC algorithm with conditional Gaussian test
# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)

  # similarly, one could do
  tetrad_pc <- tetrad_pc |> set_knowledge(kn)
  disco_tetrad_pc_new <- tetrad_pc(tpcExample)
}

# use causalDisco's own tges algorithm with temporal BIC score
cd_tges <- tges(engine = "causalDisco", score = "tbic")
disco_cd_tges <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = cd_tges, knowledge = kn)
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tges)
```

### Bugfixes

- `Tetrad` does not use required knowledge correctly yet. If giving required edges it says 
`Orienting edge (Knowledge): youth_x3 --> oldage_x5` but doesn't seem to do anything? I can make it return this edge
`youth_x3 o-o oldage_x5` or simply make it miss the edge entirely. See [unit tests for pc](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-pc.R#L47)

Forbidden seems to work correctly.

- `Tetrad` does not use tier knowledge correctly yet. If giving tier knowledge it still returns undirected edges between
tiers (see [unit tests for pc](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-pc.R#L1)). 
Could it be because the graph looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
violations <- causalDisco:::check_tier_violations(edges, kn)
> violations
# A tibble: 2 × 5
  from      edge  to       tier_from tier_to
  <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <int>   <int>
1 oldage_x5 ---   youth_x3         3       2
2 oldage_x6 ---   youth_x4         3       2
```

And it only tries to fix it from the other way? I.e. if to and from were swapped? More investigation needed ...

- Some of our algorithms (`tfci`, more?) with engine `causalDisco` does not currently work correctly with tier knowledge

  - "tier" knowledge gives bidirectional edges that violate the tiers (see e.g. [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)).
  and the example output:
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
violations <- causalDisco:::check_tier_violations(edges, kn)
> violations
# A tibble: 4 × 5
  from     edge  to        tier_from tier_to
  <chr>    <chr> <chr>         <int>   <int>
1 child_x2 <->   oldage_x5         3       1
2 youth_x3 <->   oldage_x5         2       1
3 youth_x4 <->   oldage_x5         2       1
4 youth_x4 <->   oldage_x6         2       1
```

Probably just the knowledge not knowing how to handle bi-directional edges (since it works with `tges` on un-directed edges)? 

- All of our algorithms (I think?) does not work with required edges from knowledge objects (see e.g. [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)).
Currently does nothing.

- Some of our algorithms does not work with forbidden edges from knowledge objects (see e.g. [unit tests for tges](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tges.R)).
It does however work for `tfci` with engine `causalDisco` (see [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)).

- Piping as done above for `Tetrad` loses `$knowledge$tiers` information.

- inst/roxygen-examples/TetradSearch_example.R fails for set.seed(16) (works for seed 1-15) with error:

```{r error Tetrad pc}
# Error in .jcall("RJavaTools", "Ljava/lang/Object;", "invokeMethod", cl,  : 
#  java.lang.RuntimeException
```

Maybe v7.6.9 fixes it?

### Documentation 

- List of available tests for `pc` (and more probably)? Can see `"conditional_gaussian"`, `"mi"`, and `"fisher_z"` exists. What else?

- List in documentation of `tfci`, ... what kind of graph it returns. `tfci` gives a PAG, right? Currently it returns `graph_class: UNKNOWN`
  - Either wait/help for `caugi` to implement different classes
  - Or we implement a function that converts `caugi` output to specific graph classes based on algorithm/edges?
  - Update plotting function to work correctly with different graph classes.

- Make vignettes

- Make it clear somewhere what/how knowledge is supported in which algorithms. E.g. `pc` with engine `pcalg` only works
with forbidden edges from knowledge objects and requires specifying both ways:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
kn <- knowledge(
    tpcExample,
    forbidden(child_x1 ~ youth_x3),
    forbidden(youth_x3 ~ child_x1)
  )
```

It's documented in `?as_pcalg_constaints` but should be more visible.

Maybe make it possible to check documentation of engine via `?pcalg` and similar for the rest?

### Standardization

- We are mixing between different things currently:
  - `tibble` vs `data.frame` (e.g. `knowledge` is `tibble` and `disco()$caugi@edges` is `data.frame`)
  - `S3` vs `S7`
  - More maybe?

### Adopt Tetrad v7.6.9

- Move to `Tetrad` v7.6.9. v7.6.9 removes the folder [algcomparison/algorithm/cluster](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/tree/v7.6.8/tetrad-lib/src/main/java/edu/cmu/tetrad/algcomparison/algorithm/cluster)

Was removed in this commit https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/commit/295dceef6b83ac08ff0032fb194cf3ee5e429337#diff-adf829223cc59eac11682310f8a77c0ec3cf26a5b4310d75ec8edfaa86dd285b

[Changelog](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases) item 14 says 
"and a generalization of GFFC (Generalized Find Factor Clusters) of FOFC and FTFC, providing multiple strategies for discovering latent clusterings from measurement data."

so we need to implement this in `causalDisco` (help?)

### Features

- Add a `seed` argument to `disco()`?

- Allow `disco()` to not take a knowledge object? Currently for no knowledge you have to pass `knowledge = knowledge()`.
And this is not allowed in some algorithms (e.g. `pc` with engine `pcalg`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
out_no_kn <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = pcalg_pc, knowledge = knowledge())
Error: `labels` contained variables that were not in the knowledge object: [child_x2, child_x1, youth_x4, youth_x3, oldage_x6, oldage_x5]
```

### CRAN TODO

- Add a copyright holder (`"cph"`) in persons field of DESCRIPTION (needed for CRAN, see [here](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks))

- Update Description: field in DESCRIPTION to mention it wraps other packages, ...
