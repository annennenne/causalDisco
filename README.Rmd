causalDisco provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax. 

## Motivation

Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in bnlearn, pcalg, or Tetrad, but their APIs vary widely.

causalDisco unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on scientific questions rather than package quirks.

Time to hit the disco 🪩

## Installation 

### Install causalDisco

To install causalDisco ensure you first have installed Rust as described below.

Then you can install the development version of causalDisco from GitHub using pak:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco")
```

or with all suggested packages (note that this requires a valid Java / JDK installation for rJava as described below):

```{r install w depend, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing Rust

causalDisco depends on the package [caugi](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for instructions on how to
install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

causalDisco provides an interface to the Java library [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from Tetrad you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 21.
We recommend Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK), available at https://adoptium.net for all major operating systems.

We provide a helper function to install Temurin JDK 25 on macOS and Windows:

```{r install java, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_java()
```

The current supported version of Tetrad can then be installed by calling

```{r install tetrad, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

To verify everything is set up correctly you can run `check_tetrad_install()`:

```{r check tetrad install}
causalDisco::check_tetrad_install()
```

## Example

With causalDisco you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the package causalDisco itself,
the Java library Tetrad, the R package bnlearn, and the R package pcalg.

```{r example}
library(causalDisco)

# load data
data("tpc_example")

# define background knowledge object
kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

# use Tetrad PC algorithm with conditional Gaussian test
# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)

  # similarly, one could do
  tetrad_pc <- tetrad_pc |> set_knowledge(kn)
  disco_tetrad_pc_new <- tetrad_pc(tpc_example)
}

# use causalDisco's own tges algorithm with temporal BIC score
cd_tges <- tges(engine = "causalDisco", score = "tbic")
disco_cd_tges <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = cd_tges, knowledge = kn)
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tges)
```

## TODO

- Improve plot (use caugi)

  - For new features that are hard to do in grid (which caugi uses), maybe just insert the image in ggplot?
  
A rough WIP is here, which colors a rectangle around A and B:

```{r plot wip, eval = FALSE}
# Make sure causalDisco is not loaded to avoid namespace conflicts with caugi
if ("package:causalDisco" %in% search()) {
  detach("package:causalDisco", unload = TRUE, character.only = TRUE)
}

library(caugi) # Needs recent version from GitHub
library(ggplot2)
library(ggplotify)
library(grid)

cg <- caugi(A %-->% B, C, D)
layout <- caugi_layout(cg)
print(layout)
layout$x <- c(0.5, 0.5, 0, 1)
layout$y <- c(0, 1, 0.5, 0.5)
print(layout)
plot_cg <- plot(cg, layout = layout)

# Wrap the grid plot as ggplot
gg <- as.ggplot(~grid.draw(plot_cg@grob))

# Add rectangle
gg +
  annotate(
    "rect",
    xmin = layout$x[1] - 0.05,
    xmax = layout$x[2] + 0.05,
    ymin = layout$y[1],
    ymax = layout$y[2],
    fill = "red",
    alpha = 0.3
  )
```

![](man/figures/caugi-modified-plot.png)
  
  - Implement a working `make_tikz` for these plots. See tikzDevice package, which can do it automatically from R plots:
  
```{r tikzDevice example, eval=FALSE}
library(caugi)
library(tikzDevice)
cg <- caugi(A %-->% B + C)
tikz("cg_plot.tex", width = 6, height = 4)
plot(
  cg,
  node_style = list(
    by_node = list(
      A = list(fill = "lightblue", col = "darkblue", lwd = 2),
      B = list(fill = "red")
    )
  )
)
dev.off()
```
  
If we want any changes we can modify the tikz code after generation.

- Make required work for our algorithms. It breaks when it internally calls `tpdag`, so look into that...

- Make score/test/alg names consistent. Currently a mix of snake_case, kebab-case, and period.case. - done? Still
missing algorithms.

- In documentation of defaults for tests maybe add the underlying engine defaults if they differ?

- In documentation of test / scores say which data types they support (continuous, discrete, mixed).

### Longterm

- Once more developed look at https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn and add it as an engine?

### Bugfixes

- bnlearn has bug for old version of caugi. Fixed in PR #149 in caugi.

- Tried implementing it in the scores (e.g. `TemporalBdeu`) by giving it score -Inf if missing a required edge,
  but then it runs forever. I.e. adding the following to `local.score`
  
```{r attempted fix, eval = FALSE}
vertex_name <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[vertex]
req_parents <- kn$edges |>
dplyr::filter(status == "required", to == vertex_name) |>
dplyr::pull(from)

parent_names <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[parents]
missing_required <- !all(req_parents %in% parent_names)
if (missing_required) {
  return(-Inf)
}
```

The algorithm needs to be modified when having required edges, I think.

Should be easier to fix for test based algorithms? Just check if required edges are present after skeleton phase and add them if missing? (and forbid them from being removed in orientation phase). Look at fixedEdges in pcalg.

  - Look into how (if) possible to pass to pcalg.

- Piping as done above for Tetrad in the example section loses `$knowledge$tiers` information due to how
  builders/closures capture knowledge.

  - Fixing requires refactoring the disco_method builder design I think.

#### Tetrad issues

- Tetrad does not use required correctly in `fci` algorithm

```{r tetrad required bug}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    child_x1 %-->% youth_x3
  )
  
  tetrad_fci <- fci(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_fci, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

Fixed in unreleased version of Tetrad (see #1947 in Tetrad issues).

### Documentation 

- Make it clear in `?BnlearnSearch` (and similar for the others) that all algorithms aren't currently fully supported.

- Use `snake_case` for all exported functions + arguments (even if the underlying engine uses e.g. camelCase) - done?

- See how `mlr3` does it, and see their wiki on roxygen R6 guide [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Roxygen-R6-Guide).

- List in documentation of `tfci`, ... what kind of graph it returns.

- Make vignettes

### Standardization

- We are mixing between different things currently (since we rely on `caugi` are it uses `data.frame` and `S7`):
  - `tibble` vs `data.frame` (e.g. `knowledge` is `tibble` and `disco()$caugi@edges` is `data.frame`).
  
Call `caugi@edges <- tibble::as_tibble(caugi@edges)` internally to standardize to tibble? And instead of forcing users
to do `output$caugi@edges` (mix S3 and S7) we could implement something like this:

```{r edges example, eval=FALSE}
edges <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("edges")
}

edges.knowledgeable_caugi <- function(x) {
  tibble::as_tibble(x$caugi@edges)
}

nodes <- function(x) {
  UseMethod("nodes")
}

nodes.knowledgeable_caugi <- function(x) {
  tibble::as_tibble(x$caugi@edges)
}
```

I.e., allow user to call `edges(output)` and `nodes(output)` to get edges and nodes as tibbles.

### CRAN TODO

- Add a copyright holder (`"cph"`) in persons field of DESCRIPTION (needed for CRAN, see [here](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks))

- Update Description: field in DESCRIPTION to mention it wraps other packages, ...
