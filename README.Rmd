causalDisco provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax.

## Motivation

Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in bnlearn, pcalg, or Tetrad, but their APIs vary widely.

causalDisco unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on
scientific questions rather than package quirks.

Time to hit the disco 🪩

## Installation 

### Install causalDisco

To install causalDisco ensure you first have installed Rust as described below.

Then you can install the stable version of causalDisco from CRAN with suggested dependencies using

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("causalDisco", dependencies = TRUE)
```

or the development version of causalDisco from GitHub using pak:

```{r install w depend, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("disco-coders/causalDisco", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing Rust

causalDisco depends on the package [caugi](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/ for instructions on how to install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

causalDisco provides an interface to the Java library [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from Tetrad you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 21.
We recommend Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK), available at https://adoptium.net for all major operating systems.

Alternatively, we provide a helper function to install Temurin JDK 25 on macOS and Windows:

```{r install java, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_java()
```

The current supported version of Tetrad can then be installed by calling

```{r install tetrad, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

To verify everything is set up correctly you can run `check_tetrad_install()`:

```{r check tetrad install}
causalDisco::check_tetrad_install()
```

## Example

With causalDisco you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the package causalDisco itself,
the the R packages bnlearn and pcalg, and the Java application Tetrad with a consistent syntax. Here we provide
a simple example of how to use these different backends with the same code structure.
We also show how to incorporate tiered background knowledge.

```{r example}
library(causalDisco)

# Load data
data(tpc_example)

pcalg_ges <- ges(
  engine = "pcalg", # Use the pcalg implementation
  score = "sem_bic" # Use BIC score for model selection
)
disco_pcalg_ges <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = pcalg_ges)

# We can also pass background knowledge to the engines that support it. Here we use tiered knowledge,
# which is a common way to encode temporal ordering of variables.
kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"), # Using the tidyselect syntax to select variables for each tier
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

cd_tpc <- tpc(
  engine = "causalDisco", # Use the causalDisco implementation
  test = "fisher_z", # Use Fisher's Z test for conditional independence
  alpha = 0.05 # Significance level for the test
)
disco_cd_tpc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = cd_tpc, knowledge = kn)

bnlearn_pc <- pc(
  engine = "bnlearn", # Use the bnlearn implementation
  test = "cor", # Use Pearson correlation test for conditional independence
  alpha = 0.05
)
disco_bnlearn_pc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = bnlearn_pc, knowledge = kn)

# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(
    engine = "tetrad", # Use the Tetrad implementation
    test = "conditional_gaussian", # Use conditional Gaussian test
    alpha = 0.05
  )
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)
}
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tpc)
```

Please see the package vignettes for more detailed introductions to the package and its features, such as how to
incorporate knowledge, run causal discovery, and visualize results.
