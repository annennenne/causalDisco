`causalDisco` provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax. 

## Motivation

Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in bnlearn, pcalg, or Tetrad, but their APIs vary widely.

causalDisco unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on scientific questions rather than package quirks.

Time to hit the disco 🪩

## Installation 

### Install causalDisco

To install causalDisco ensure you first have installed Rust as described below.

Then you can install the development version of causalDisco from GitHub using pak:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco")
```

or with all suggested packages (note that this requires a valid Java / JDK installation for rJava as described below):

```{r install w depend, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing Rust

causalDisco depends on the package [caugi](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for instructions on how to
install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

`causalDisco` provides an interface to the Java library [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from Tetrad you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 21.
We recommend Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK), available at https://adoptium.net for all major operating systems.

We provide a helper function to install Temurin JDK 25 on macOS and Windows:

```{r install java, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_java()
```

You may also refer to Tetrad's
[Java setup guide](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Java-for-Tetrad).

The current supported version of Tetrad can then be installed by calling

```{r install tetrad, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

To verify everything is set up correctly you can run `check_tetrad_install()`:

```{r check tetrad install}
causalDisco::check_tetrad_install()
```

## Example

With causalDisco you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the package causalDisco itself,
the Java library Tetrad, the R package bnlearn, and the R package pcalg.

```{r example}
# options(causalDisco.tetrad.version = "7.6.9") # Memory issues are fixed on v7.6.9
library(causalDisco)

# load data
data("tpc_example")

# define background knowledge object
kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

# use Tetrad PC algorithm with conditional Gaussian test
# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)

  # similarly, one could do
  tetrad_pc <- tetrad_pc |> set_knowledge(kn)
  disco_tetrad_pc_new <- tetrad_pc(tpc_example)
}

# use causalDisco's own tges algorithm with temporal BIC score
cd_tges <- tges(engine = "causalDisco", score = "tbic")
disco_cd_tges <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = cd_tges, knowledge = kn)
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tges)
```

## Questions

- `tpc` and `tfci` have default $\alpha = 0.05$, but the underlying `tpc_run` and `tfci_run` have $\alpha = 0.1$.

- Shouldn't we just list all possible arguments to `tpc`, `tfci`, and `tges` instead of `...` and forcing the user
to look at the underlying `_run` functions? Then also make the `_run` functions not exported?

## TODO

- Improve plot
  - Add some of the arguments from `plot_tempo_mech` (such as time_axis, ...)

- Make required work for our algorithms. It breaks when it internally calls `tpdag`, so look into that...

- Make score/test/alg names consistent. Currently a mix of snake_case, kebab-case, and period.case.

### Manging exported functions

- Do we need to export the run functions (`tpc_run`, ...) if we recommend user to use `disco()` with the method functions (`tpc`, ...)?

- Various helper functions: `as_pcalg_constraints`, ..., `is_knowledgeable_caugi`, ..., `tetrad_graph`

### Bugfixes

- bnlearn has bug for old version of caugi. Fixed in PR #149 in caugi.

- All of our algorithm does not work with required edges from knowledge objects (see e.g. [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)), `tpc`, `tges`, ...
Currently does nothing. Either make it work or throw error/warning if required edges are given.
  
  - Tried implementing it in the scores (e.g. `TemporalBdeu`) by giving it score -Inf if missing a required edge,
  but then it runs forever. I.e. adding the following to `local.score`
  
```{r attempted fix, eval = FALSE}
vertex_name <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[vertex]
req_parents <- kn$edges |>
dplyr::filter(status == "required", to == vertex_name) |>
dplyr::pull(from)

parent_names <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[parents]
missing_required <- !all(req_parents %in% parent_names)
if (missing_required) {
  return(-Inf)
}
```

The algorithm needs to be modified when having required edges, I think.

Should be easier to fix for test based algorithms? Just check if required edges are present after skeleton phase and add them if missing? (and forbid them from being removed in orientation phase). Look at fixedEdges in pcalg.

  - Look into how (if) possible to pass to pcalg.

- Piping as done above for Tetrad in the example section loses `$knowledge$tiers` information due to how
  builders/closures capture knowledge.

  - Fixing requires refactoring the disco_method builder design I think.

#### Tetrad issues

- v7.6.9 of Tetrad seems to fix the memory issues.

- Tetrad does not use required correctly in `fci` algorithm

```{r tetrad required bug}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    child_x1 %-->% youth_x3
  )
  
  tetrad_fci <- fci(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_fci, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

The required edge is missing.

- Non-working Tetrad test/score arguments `"cci"`, `"probalistic"`, and `"mixed_variable_polynomial"`:

```{r tetrad non-working arg cci, error = TRUE}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "cci", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc)
}
```

```{r tetrad non-working arg probabilistic, error = TRUE}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")
  
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "probabilistic")
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc)
}
```

```{r tetrad non-working arg mixed_variable_polynomial, error = TRUE}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed && check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")
  
  tetrad_ges <- ges(engine = "tetrad", score = "mixed_variable_polynomial")
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_ges)
}
```

### Documentation 

- Make it clear in `?BnlearnSearch` (and similar for the others) that all algorithms aren't currently fully supported.

- Use `snake_case` for all exported functions + arguments (even if the underlying engine uses e.g. camelCase).

- See how `mlr3` does it, and see their wiki on roxygen R6 guide [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Roxygen-R6-Guide).

- Make it clear somewhere what/how knowledge is supported in which algorithms. E.g. `pc` with engine pcalg only works
with forbidden edges from knowledge objects and requires specifying both ways. It's documented in `?as_pcalg_constaints` but should be more visible. In `?PcalgSearch` probably?

- List in documentation of `tfci`, ... what kind of graph it returns.

- Make vignettes

### Standardization

- We are mixing between different things currently (since we rely on `caugi` are it uses `data.frame` and `S7`):
  - `tibble` vs `data.frame` (e.g. `knowledge` is `tibble` and `disco()$caugi@edges` is `data.frame`)
  - `S3` vs `S7`
  - More maybe?

### Adopt Tetrad v7.6.9

- Move to Tetrad v7.6.9. v7.6.9 removes the folder [algcomparison/algorithm/cluster](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/tree/v7.6.8/tetrad-lib/src/main/java/edu/cmu/tetrad/algcomparison/algorithm/cluster)

Was removed in this commit https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/commit/295dceef6b83ac08ff0032fb194cf3ee5e429337#diff-adf829223cc59eac11682310f8a77c0ec3cf26a5b4310d75ec8edfaa86dd285b

[Changelog](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases) item 14 says 
"and a generalization of GFFC (Generalized Find Factor Clusters) of FOFC and FTFC, providing multiple strategies for discovering latent clusterings from measurement data."

so we need to implement this in `causalDisco` (help?)

This also doesn't work on 7.6.9:

```{r v7.6.9 another bug, eval=FALSE}
> load_all()
ℹ Loading causalDisco
causalDisco startup:
  Java heap size requested: 2 GB
  Tetrad version: 7.6.9
  Java successfully initialized with 2 GB.
  To change heap size, set options(java.heap.size = 'Ng') or Sys.setenv(JAVA_HEAP_SIZE = 'Ng') *before* loading.
  Restart R to apply changes.
  
> var1 <- c(1.2, 2.3, 3.1, 4.5)
> var2 <- c(5.1, 6.2, 7.3, 8.4)
> df <- data.frame(var1, var2)
> tetrad_data <- rdata_to_tetrad(df)
Error in rdata_to_tetrad(df) : 
  java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: edu/cmu/tetrad/data/DiscreteVariable
```

KCI test from Tetrad in pc algorithm gives wrong graph in getting started vignette (non-linear data) when
version is 7.6.9? Works correctly in 7.6.8.

### CRAN TODO

- Add a copyright holder (`"cph"`) in persons field of DESCRIPTION (needed for CRAN, see [here](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks))

- Update Description: field in DESCRIPTION to mention it wraps other packages, ...
