`causalDisco` provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax. 

## Motivation

Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in bnlearn, pcalg, or Tetrad, but their APIs vary widely.

causalDisco unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on scientific questions rather than package quirks.

Time to hit the disco 🪩

## Installation 

### Install causalDisco

To install causalDisco ensure you first have installed Rust as described below.

Then you can install the development version of causalDisco from GitHub using pak:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco")
```

or with all suggested packages (note that this requires a valid Java / JDK installation for rJava as described below):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing Rust

causalDisco depends on the package [caugi](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for instructions on how to
install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

`causalDisco` provides an interface to the Java library [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from Tetrad you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK) >= 21.
We recommend Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK), available at https://adoptium.net for all major operating systems.

We provide a helper function to install Temurin JDK 25 on macOS and Windows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_java()
```

You may also refer to Tetrad's
[Java setup guide](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Java-for-Tetrad).

The current supported version of Tetrad can then be installed by calling

```{r, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

To verify everything is set up correctly you can run `check_tetrad_install()`:

```{r}
causalDisco::check_tetrad_install()
```

## Example

With causalDisco you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the package causalDisco itself,
the Java library Tetrad, the R package bnlearn, and the R package pcalg.

```{r example}
options(causalDisco.tetrad.version = "7.6.9") # Memory issues are fixed on v7.6.9
library(causalDisco)

# load data
data("tpc_example")

# define background knowledge object
kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

# use Tetrad PC algorithm with conditional Gaussian test
# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)

  # similarly, one could do
  tetrad_pc <- tetrad_pc |> set_knowledge(kn)
  disco_tetrad_pc_new <- tetrad_pc(tpc_example)
}

# use causalDisco's own tges algorithm with temporal BIC score
cd_tges <- tges(engine = "causalDisco", score = "tbic")
disco_cd_tges <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = cd_tges, knowledge = kn)
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tges)
```

## Questions

- We say in `?BnlearnSearch` (and implemented in `bnlearn_search`) various algorithms such as `gs`, `iamb`. However,
we don't have a `gs(), iamb()` function exported (similar to how we have a `pc()` function). Should we add these functions? 

Is it a work in progress? If so we need to document this in `?BnlearnSearch` (and similar for other functions)?.

- Making arguments and function naming consistent (snake_case). How much do we wanna match the corresponding e.g. pcalg naming? "fixedEdges" vs "fixed_edges", "suffStat" vs "suff_stat", "maj.rule" vs "maj_rule", ... 
Atm we have a mix of both styles, so hard for user to know which to use (especially if their starting point is our package).

## TODO

### Manging exported functions

- Do we need to export the run functions (`tpc_run`, ...) if we recommend user to use `disco()` with the method functions (`tpc`, ...)?

- Various helper functions: `as_pcalg_constraints`, ..., `is_knowledgeable_caugi`, ..., `tetrad_graph`

### Bugfixes

#### causalDisco issues

- `tpc` with engine `"causalDisco"` does not currently work correctly with tier knowledge

```{r}
data("tpc_example")

kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

my_tpc <- tpc(engine = "causalDisco", test = "fisher_z")

output <- disco(tpc_example, my_tpc, knowledge = kn)
edges <- output$caugi@edges

violations <- causalDisco:::check_tier_violations(edges, kn)
violations
```

- All of our algorithms (I think?) does not work with required edges from knowledge objects (see e.g. [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)), `tpc`, `tges`, ...
Currently does nothing. Either make it work or throw error/warning if required edges are given.
  
  - Tried implementing it in the scores (e.g. `TemporalBdeu`) by giving it score -Inf if missing a required edge,
  but then it runs forever. I.e. adding the following to `local.score`
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vertex_name <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[vertex]
req_parents <- kn$edges |>
dplyr::filter(status == "required", to == vertex_name) |>
dplyr::pull(from)

parent_names <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[parents]
missing_required <- !all(req_parents %in% parent_names)
if (missing_required) {
  return(-Inf)
}
```

The algorithm needs to be modified when having required edges, I think.

  - Look into how (if) possible to pass to pcalg.

- Piping as done above for Tetrad in the example section loses `$knowledge$tiers` information due to how
  builders/closures capture knowledge.

  - Fixing requires refactoring the disco_method builder design I think.

`ges()` with engine pcalg gives warning about required edges when we don't specify any?

```{r}
data("tpc_example")
kn <- knowledge(
  tpc_example,
  forbidden(child_x1 ~ youth_x3),
  forbidden(youth_x3 ~ child_x1)
)

pcalg_ges <- ges(engine = "pcalg", score = "sem_bic")
output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = pcalg_ges, knowledge = kn)
```

#### Tetrad issues

- v7.6.9 of Tetrad seems to fix the memory issues.

- Tetrad does not use required correctly

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    required(child_x1 ~ youth_x3)
  )
  
  tetrad_fci <- fci(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_fci, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

The required edge is missing. Furthermore, in `pc` it gives undirected edges between the required edges.

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    required(child_x1 ~ oldage_x5)
  )
  
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

- Also gives undirected edges in tier knowledge?

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    tier(
      child ~ starts_with("child"),
      youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
      old ~ starts_with("old")
    )
  )

  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

Added a bunch of `browser()` statements in TetradSearch and the knowledge is correctly passed to Tetrad, so not sure
what is going on here.

Is this expected?

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpc_example")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpc_example,
    forbidden(child_x2 ~ child_x1)
  )

  tetrad_fci <- fci(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpc_example, method = tetrad_fci, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

Or should the edge between `child_x2` and `child_x1` be `--o` instead of `o--o`?

### Documentation 

- See how `mlr3` does it, and see their wiki on roxygen R6 guide [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Roxygen-R6-Guide).

- Make it clear somewhere what/how knowledge is supported in which algorithms. E.g. `pc` with engine pcalg only works
with forbidden edges from knowledge objects and requires specifying both ways. It's documented in `?as_pcalg_constaints` but should be more visible. In `?PcalgSearch` probably?

- List in documentation of `tfci`, ... what kind of graph it returns.

- Make vignettes

- Make all function args be snake_case. Note, that modifying these: `fixedGaps`, `fixedEdges`, `suffStat`, `methodOri` breaks tests since they are passed to pcalg. But, can you inside functions rename them to what pcalg expects.

### Standardization

- We are mixing between different things currently (since we rely on `caugi` are it uses `data.frame` and `S7`):
  - `tibble` vs `data.frame` (e.g. `knowledge` is `tibble` and `disco()$caugi@edges` is `data.frame`)
  - `S3` vs `S7`
  - More maybe?

### Adopt Tetrad v7.6.9

- Move to Tetrad v7.6.9. v7.6.9 removes the folder [algcomparison/algorithm/cluster](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/tree/v7.6.8/tetrad-lib/src/main/java/edu/cmu/tetrad/algcomparison/algorithm/cluster)

Was removed in this commit https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/commit/295dceef6b83ac08ff0032fb194cf3ee5e429337#diff-adf829223cc59eac11682310f8a77c0ec3cf26a5b4310d75ec8edfaa86dd285b

[Changelog](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases) item 14 says 
"and a generalization of GFFC (Generalized Find Factor Clusters) of FOFC and FTFC, providing multiple strategies for discovering latent clusterings from measurement data."

so we need to implement this in `causalDisco` (help?)

This also doesn't work on 7.6.9

```{r, eval=FALSE}
