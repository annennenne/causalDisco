<!-- badges: end -->

`causalDisco` provides a unified interface for causal discovery on observational data.
It wraps multiple causal discovery backends under a common, consistent syntax. 

## Motivation

Causal discovery methods exist in many ecosystems, for example in `bnlearn`, `pcalg`, or `Tetrad`, but their APIs vary widely.

`causalDisco` unifies them under one clear grammar, making it easy to compare results, switch algorithms, and focus on scientific questions rather than package quirks.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
  cat("Time to hit the disco 🪩\n")
} else {
  cat("Time to hit the disco\n")  # safe fallback for CRAN PDF
}
```

## Installation 

### Install `causalDisco`

To install `causalDisco` ensure you first have installed Rust and Java/JDK as described below.

Then you can install the development version of `causalDisco` from GitHub using `pak`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco")
```

### Installing Rust

`causalDisco` depends on the package [`caugi`](https://github.com/frederikfabriciusbjerre/caugi), which requires Rust to
be installed on your system. See https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for instructions on how to
install Rust.

### Installing Java / JDK

`causalDisco` provides an interface to the Java library [`Tetrad`](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) for
causal discovery algorithms. To use algorithms from `Tetrad` you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK).
We recommend Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK), available at https://adoptium.net 

You may also refer to `Tetrad`'s
[Java setup guide](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/wiki/Setting-up-Java-for-Tetrad).

The current supported version of `Tetrad` can then be installed by calling

```{r, eval=FALSE}
causalDisco::install_tetrad()
```

## Example

With `causalDisco` you can currently run causal discovery algorithms from the packages `causalDisco` itself,
the Java library `Tetrad`, `bnlearn`, and `pcalg`.

```{r example}
library(causalDisco)

# load data
data("tpcExample")

# define background knowledge object
kn <- knowledge(
  tpcExample,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

# use Tetrad PC algorithm with conditional Gaussian test
# Requires Tetrad to be installed
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  disco_tetrad_pc <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)

  # similarly, one could do
  tetrad_pc <- tetrad_pc |> set_knowledge(kn)
  disco_tetrad_pc_new <- tetrad_pc(tpcExample)
}

# use causalDisco's own tges algorithm with temporal BIC score
cd_tges <- tges(engine = "causalDisco", score = "tbic")
disco_cd_tges <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = cd_tges, knowledge = kn)
```

You can visualize the resulting causal graph using the `plot()` function:

```{r plot}
#| fig.alt: "A causal graph with the known tiers indicated by vertical positioning of the nodes."
plot(disco_cd_tges)
```

## Questions

- We say in `?bnlearnSearch` (and implemented in `bnlearn_search`) various algorithms such as `gs`, `iamb`. However,
we don't have a `gs(), iamb()` function exported (similar to how we have a `pc()` function). Should we add these functions? 

Is it a work in progress? If so we need to document this in `?bnlearnSearch` (and similar for other functions)?.

## TODO

### Manging exported functions

- Do we need to export the run functions (`tpc_run`, ...) if we recommend user to use `disco()` with the method functions (`tpc`, ...)?

- Various helper functions: `as_pcalg_constraints`, ..., `is_knowledgeable_caugi`, ..., `tetrad_graph`

### Dependencies

- Currently you can't install `causalDisco` without having Java/JDK installed. Move all `rJava` stuff to optional and
start up only initialize `rJava` if installed?

### Bugfixes

#### causalDisco issues

- `tpc` with engine `causalDisco` does not currently work correctly with tier knowledge

```{r}
data("tpcExample")

kn <- knowledge(
  tpcExample,
  tier(
    child ~ starts_with("child"),
    youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
    old ~ starts_with("old")
  )
)

my_tpc <- tpc(engine = "causalDisco", test = "fisher_z")

output <- disco(tpcExample, my_tpc, knowledge = kn)
edges <- output$caugi@edges

violations <- causalDisco:::check_tier_violations(edges, kn)
violations
```

- All of our algorithms (I think?) does not work with required edges from knowledge objects (see e.g. [unit tests for tfci](https://github.com/BjarkeHautop/causalDisco/tree/master/tests/testthat/test-tfci.R)), `tpc`, `tges`, ...
Currently does nothing. Either make it work or throw error/warning if required edges are given.
  
  - Tried implementing it in the scores (e.g. `TemporalBdeu`) by giving it score -Inf if missing a required edge,
  but then it runs forever. I.e. adding the following to `local.score`
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vertex_name <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[vertex]
req_parents <- kn$edges |>
dplyr::filter(status == "required", to == vertex_name) |>
dplyr::pull(from)

parent_names <- colnames(pp.dat$data)[parents]
missing_required <- !all(req_parents %in% parent_names)
if (missing_required) {
  return(-Inf)
}
```

The algorithm needs to be modified when having required edges, I think.

  - Look into how (if) possible to pass to `pcalg`.

- Piping as done above for `Tetrad` in the example section loses `$knowledge$tiers` information due to how
  builders/closures capture knowledge.

  - Fixing requires refactoring the disco_method builder design I think.

pcalg::ges() gives warning about required edges when we don't specify any?

```{r}
data("tpcExample")
kn <- knowledge(
  tpcExample,
  forbidden(child_x1 ~ youth_x3),
  forbidden(youth_x3 ~ child_x1)
)

pcalg_ges <- ges(engine = "pcalg", score = "sem_bic")
output <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = pcalg_ges, knowledge = kn)
```

#### Tetrad issues

`Tetrad` v7.6.9 might fix some of these issues? Confirmed same issue on v7.6.7 and v7.6.9.

- Fixed memory issue from `rJava` by calling garbage collector in disco if using `Tetrad`. However, first call using
`Tetrad` now gives

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Dec 08, 2025 3:33:40 PM java.util.prefs.FileSystemPreferences loadCache
WARNING: Prefs file removed in background /home/bjarke/.java/.userPrefs/prefs.xml
```

- `Tetrad` does not use required correctly

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpcExample")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpcExample,
    required(child_x1 ~ youth_x3)
  )
  
  tetrad_fci <- fci(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = tetrad_fci, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

and

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpcExample")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpcExample,
    required(child_x1 ~ youth_x3)
  )
  
  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

- Was this fine? Undirected edges in tier knowledge?

```{r}
if (check_tetrad_install()$installed || check_tetrad_install()$java_ok) {
  data("tpcExample")

  kn <- knowledge(
    tpcExample,
    tier(
      child ~ starts_with("child"),
      youth ~ starts_with("youth"),
      old ~ starts_with("old")
    )
  )

  tetrad_pc <- pc(engine = "tetrad", test = "conditional_gaussian", alpha = 0.05)
  output <- disco(data = tpcExample, method = tetrad_pc, knowledge = kn)
  edges <- output$caugi@edges
  edges
}
```

### Documentation 

- Make templates.

- Structure the documentation better. See See how `mlr3` does it, and see their wiki on roxygen R6 guide [here](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Roxygen-R6-Guide).

  - Make it clear somewhere what/how knowledge is supported in which algorithms. E.g. `pc` with engine `pcalg` only works
with forbidden edges from knowledge objects and requires specifying both ways. It's documented in `?as_pcalg_constaints` but should be more visible.

Maybe make it possible to check documentation of engine via `?pcalg` and similar for the rest?

  - List in documentation of `tfci`, ... what kind of graph it returns. `tfci` gives a PAG, right? Currently it returns `graph_class: UNKNOWN`
    - Either wait/help for `caugi` to implement different classes
    - Or we implement a function that converts `caugi` output to specific graph classes based on algorithm/edges?
    - Update plotting function to work correctly with different graph classes.

- Make vignettes

### Standardization

- We are mixing between different things currently (since we rely on `caugi` are it uses `data.frame` and `S7`):
  - `tibble` vs `data.frame` (e.g. `knowledge` is `tibble` and `disco()$caugi@edges` is `data.frame`)
  - `S3` vs `S7`
  - More maybe?

### Adopt Tetrad v7.6.9

- Move to `Tetrad` v7.6.9. v7.6.9 removes the folder [algcomparison/algorithm/cluster](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/tree/v7.6.8/tetrad-lib/src/main/java/edu/cmu/tetrad/algcomparison/algorithm/cluster)

Was removed in this commit https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/commit/295dceef6b83ac08ff0032fb194cf3ee5e429337#diff-adf829223cc59eac11682310f8a77c0ec3cf26a5b4310d75ec8edfaa86dd285b

[Changelog](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad/releases) item 14 says 
"and a generalization of GFFC (Generalized Find Factor Clusters) of FOFC and FTFC, providing multiple strategies for discovering latent clusterings from measurement data."

so we need to implement this in `causalDisco` (help?)

### CRAN TODO

- Add a copyright holder (`"cph"`) in persons field of DESCRIPTION (needed for CRAN, see [here](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/extrachecks))

- Update Description: field in DESCRIPTION to mention it wraps other packages, ...
