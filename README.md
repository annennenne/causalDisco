`causalDisco` in an R package with tools for causal discovery on observational data.


## Installation

To install the development version of `causalDisco` run the following
commands from within R (requires that the `devtools` package is already installed)

```{r}
devtools::install_github("annennenne/causalDisco")
```

Note that the package requires installation of the `pcalg` package as well, which depends on packages available only Bioconductor. There is an installation guide for `pcalg` [here](https://github.com/asreview/pcalg).  

## Temporal causal discovery

causalDisco includes an implementation of *temporal PC*, a temporal version of the PC algorithm. The following examples shows how this function may be used to produce a temporal partially directed acyclic graph (TPDAG) for an observed data set with temporal information. 
```{r}
library(causalDisco)

#Simulate data
set.seed(123)
n <- 500

child_x <- rnorm(n)^2
child_y <- 0.5*child_x + rnorm(n)
child_z <- sample(c(0,1), n, replace = TRUE, 
                  prob = c(0.3, 0.7))
adult_x <- child_x + rnorm(n)
adult_z <- as.numeric(child_z + rnorm(n) > 0)
adult_w <- 2*adult_z + rnorm(n)
adult_y <- 2*sqrt(child_x) + adult_w^2 + rnorm(n)

simdata <- data.frame(child_x, child_y, child_z,
                      adult_x, adult_z, adult_w,
                      adult_y)


#Define order
simorder <- c("child", "adult")

#Perform TPC with sparsity psi = 0.01
results <- tpc(simdata, order = simorder, sparsity = 10^(-2))

#Plot results
plot(results)


#Plot results with custom labels for variables and periods
varlabs <- list(`child_x` = "x", `child_y` = "y",
                `child_z` = "z", `adult_x` = "x",
                `adult_z` = "z", `adult_w` = "w",
                `adult_y` = "y")
perlabs <- c("Childhood", "Adulthood")
plot(results, varLabels = varlabs, periodLabels = perlabs)
```

Here is an example for using the package for plotting a user supplied adjacency matrix with order information:

```{r}
library(causalDisco)

#Adjacency matrix for the data generating mechanism for simdata
vnames <- c("child_x", "child_y", "child_z", "adult_x", 
            "adult_z", "adult_w", "adult_y")
thisamat <- matrix(c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                     1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                     0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
                     0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
                     1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0),
                    7, 7, 
                    byrow = TRUE,
                    dimnames = list(vnames, vnames))
thisorder <- c("child", "adult")

#Make temporal adjacency matrix
thistamat <- tamat(thisamat, thisorder)

#Plot
plot(thistamat)
```


## Webtool

The causalDisco webtool provides an overview of R procedures for working with causal discovery in R, including example code. The webtool can be accessed [here](https://shiny.sund.ku.dk/zms499/). Source code for the webtool is available in this repository.
