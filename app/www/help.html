<h5> Welcome to the causalDisco web tool! </h5>
This tool provides an overview of available causal discovery procedures in R for a given causal discovery problem, along with working code examples and links to where you can learn more about each procedure. I hope you find the tool useful!

<h5>Using the causalDisco tool</h5>
In order to use the tool, you should first look at the panel to the left and check of the properties that you need for your causal discovery problem. <b>causalDisco</b> will then provide a list of available R procedures that may be applicable to your problem, and if you click one of them, you will find more information about the procedure, including a working code example. All of the code examples are run on simulated example data. You can learn more about the simulated data by clicking the <i>About the data</i> pane above.
