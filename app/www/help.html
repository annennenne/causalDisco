<h5> <b> Welcome to the causalDisco web tool! </b> </h5>
This tool provides an overview of available causal discovery procedures in R for a given causal discovery problem, along with code examples and links to where you can learn more about each procedure. I hope you find the tool useful!

<h5> <b> Using the causalDisco tool </b> </h5>
In order to use the tool, you should first look at the panel to the left and check off the properties that you need for your causal discovery problem. <b>causalDisco</b> will then provide a list of available R procedures that may be applicable to your problem, and if you click on one of them, you will find more information about the procedure, including a working code example. All of the code examples are run on simulated example data. You can learn more about the simulated data by clicking the <i>About the data</i> pane above.
