\title{Install Eclipse Temurin JDK 25 (with JAVA_HOME configuration)}
\usage{
install_java(force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{force}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, forces reinstallation even if the JDK is
already present.}
}
\description{
Installs the Eclipse Temurin JDK 25 in the user's home directory and configures
the environment so the JDK is immediately available to the current R session.

On \strong{Windows}, this function also sets the \code{JAVA_HOME} environment variable
(both for the current session and persistently using \code{setx}) to ensure that
packages such as \strong{rJava} work without additional configuration.

On \strong{macOS}, the JDK is installed under \verb{~/temurin25} and the current R
session's \code{JAVA_HOME} is updated automatically. macOS users may need to restart
their terminal or R session for system-wide detection.

This helper function is intended for users who prefer an automated installation
or who find it inconvenient to manually download and install Java from the
Adoptium website (\url{https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases}). It ensures the JDK
is installed in a predictable location and that environment variables such as
\code{JAVA_HOME} are configured correctly for use in R, including with packages like
\strong{rJava}.

Linux is not supported by this helper, as Java is typically installed via the
system package manager.
