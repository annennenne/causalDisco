\title{Install Eclipse Temurin JDK 25}
\usage{
install_java(force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{force}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, forces reinstallation even if the JDK is
already present. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Installs the Eclipse Temurin JDK 25 in the user's home directory and configures
the environment so the JDK is immediately available to the current R session.

This function also sets the \code{JAVA_HOME} environment variable to ensure that
packages such as \strong{rJava} work without additional configuration.

This helper function is intended for users who prefer an automated installation
or who find it inconvenient to manually download and install Java from the
Adoptium website (\url{https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases}).

Linux is not supported by this helper, as Java is typically installed via the
system package manager.
