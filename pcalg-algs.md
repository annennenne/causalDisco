# Add pcalg Algorithms

This document tracks pcalg algorithms with respect to their status in
this project: whether they are already documented, should be
implemented, or should be removed. Notes include score/test
requirements, and nonstandard outputs.

## I think we have all algrorithms implemented?

Ignoring steps of the algorithms such as `skeleton` and `pdsep`?
